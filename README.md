Senior Project files for IEEE SE Con Hardware Challenge

This project will keep track of all files needed to complete the IEEE SouthEastCon Hardware Challenge.
We will be using primarily Atmel AVR products. The specific microcontroller each file is written for should be detailed at the top of each .c and .h files
